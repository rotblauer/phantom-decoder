I had to do some extra install:

Get pip

### Decode flight record TXT files from DJI GO app
#### Tested with DJI Phantom 4

The DJI GO app stores flight records for every flight, collecting data from the aircraft at ~10 Hz. 
The files are given names corresponding to the time of the flight (e.g. `DJIFlightRecord_2016-06-18_[21-05-26].txt`) 
and are stored in `/DJI/dji.pilot/FlightRecord/` on Android.

Although they have the `.txt` extension, the data is stored in an undocumented, proprietary format. This repository 
contains Python scripts for decoding the files into more useful `.csv` files, ideal for use with software like [Dashware](http://www.dashware.net/).

## How to use

Run `python txt2csv.py path-to-file.TXT`. This will create `path-to-file.csv` in the same directory as the original `.TXT` file.

## File Format

Bytes 0-11 are some sort of header and have not yet been decoded.

From byte 12 onwards, the file contains a stream of variable length frames. Each frame is structured as follows:

* Byte 0: **Frame type** - Frame types 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,15 have been observed
* Byte 1: **Payload length** - The number of bytes of data following this header
* Bytes 2-n: **Payload** - Different for each frame type. See below.
* Byte n+1: **0xFF** - Frame delimiter. This isn't really necessary, but it's there anyway.

```
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|------|----
| type (1 byte) | length (1 byte) | payload (n bytes)                        | 0xFF | ...
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|------|----
```


### Frame Types

The various frames appear with different frequencies and each contain different types of data. Position, battery, gimbal, etc. 
Their formats are described here. All multi-byte encodings are little-endian.

#### Frame 1 - **Position**

This frame is always 53 (`0x35`) bytes long. Appears at ~10 Hz

```
